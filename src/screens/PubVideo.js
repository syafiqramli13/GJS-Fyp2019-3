                      Mikania micrantha Kunth (Asteraceae) is a perennial
                      creeping vine. It originates from Central and South
                      America. This weed plant gets its nickname "Mile-a-Minute"
                      because of its fast growth. It colonise tropical forest
                      and agricultural land. The plant climb trees and shrubs,
                      and When left unattended, trees can be quickly covered
                      from the sunlight.

                    <p>
                      The plant climbs by twining spirally around a support,
                      which in the field is most often the main stem or a branch
                      of a tree plant. The climber plant scales along the entire
                      height of a the plant supporting it until the climbing
                      plant reaches the top of the support plant. The climbing
                      plant then grows profusely, producing leaves and flowers,
                      thereby "suffocating" the support plant. The plant also
                      climbs onto non-living support, whether it is a pole, dead
                      trees or stumps. In Malay language, stump is equivalent to
                      "tunggul". Hence, the plant is locally known as "selaput
                      tunggul", which means "stump covering".

                    people in which relates to their natural surrounding. The
                    environmental elements have always been a part of their main
                    source of inspiration for all their arts and crafts. In this
                    paper, the Kerchang (the orang asli puzzle) has been
                    selected as the case study. The symbiosis of the making of
                    the Kerchang, reflects the true relation with nature, and
                    it's unique cultural significance to the Orang Asli.
